### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

*For **both** a VM or App Service solution for the CMS app:*
- *Analyze costs, scalability, availability, and workflow*
- *Choose the appropriate solution (VM or App Service) for deploying the app*
- *Justify your choice*

- About costs, actually use VM must be costs than App Services, this is follow IAAS structure, If you need to deploy the big app, you need use VM instead of App Services
- Scalability, VM is my choice cause of app services support to scale horizontal and vertical scalable, depend of the system
- Availability, App services is my choice, just one click, I see my app on the cloud

### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

*Detail how the app and any other needs would have to change for you to change your decision in the last section.* 
- Basically, I choose the PAAS follow, cause of everything be setup by Azure, I don't need to do anything
- Easy to use, not to require setting environment, security, storage,...
- One click, one command, whole code will be deployed to the cloud.
-> Recap here, I choose App Services.
